# Ruby Docker Build

This is where our docker ruby base image lives. The goal of this image is to
provide a basic image for interacting with the latest ruby.

What this is not, is an image for postgres and nodejs dependencies. Those should
be derived from this image.

## Building And Deployment

The builds are automated with Docker Hub.
